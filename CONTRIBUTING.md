# Contributing to Codex

Thanks for wanting to add to my little collection! This repo is basically my personal bookmarks on steroids—a place where I keep track of really cool technical and design stuff I've come across.

## The Vibe

I'm all about **quality over quantity** here. Each resource gets picked because it's genuinely interesting, well-made, or taught me something new. Think of it like curating a really good playlist, but for dev resources.

## How to Contribute

### Got Something Cool?

1. **Drop an Issue**: Use the issue tracker to suggest new stuff
2. **Tell Me Why**: Explain what caught your eye about it
3. **Share the Details**: What makes it special or useful?
4. **Pick a Category**: Let me know where it fits

### What I'm Looking For

Before suggesting something, make sure it hits these points:

#### ✅ Actually Good
- Shows excellent design, functionality, or teaches you something valuable
- Represents best practices or does things the right way
- Well-crafted and polished

#### ✅ Makes You Think "That's Cool"
- Has a unique approach or perspective
- Made you curious to learn more
- Solves a problem in a clever way

#### ✅ Fits the Collection
- Matches one of these categories:
  - Web Design & UI/UX
  - Programming Languages
  - Themes & Visual Design
  - Wallpapers & Aesthetics
  - Arch Linux Tools
  - Neovim Tips & Tricks

#### ✅ Actually Accessible
- Publicly available (no broken links)
- Not behind a paywall (unless it's really exceptional)
- Preferably in English or well-documented

## How to Submit

When suggesting a resource, use this format:

```markdown
**Resource Name**: [Title](URL)
**Category**: [Category Name]
**Why it's cool**: Brief explanation of what caught your attention
**Key highlights**: 
- Thing 1
- Thing 2
- Thing 3
```

## How It Works

1. **I Check It Out**: I'll take a look at suggestions for relevance and quality
2. **I Test Drive It**: I personally try out resources before adding them
3. **I Add It**: Approved stuff gets added with proper formatting and context
4. **I Maintain It**: I periodically check that links still work

## What I Won't Add

- Generic or meh-quality stuff
- Things that are already in here
- Pure self-promotion (unless it's genuinely amazing)
- Stuff that doesn't fit the vibe
- Broken or inaccessible links

## Questions?

Hit me up with an issue if you have questions about contributing or ideas for making this process better.
