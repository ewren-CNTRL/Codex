### Cool Stuff I've Found

#### [Mise](https://mise.jdx.dev/)
**⭐ This one's a gem**

Seriously, this website is just gorgeous. I found this while browsing around and it totally caught my eye—the design is clean, functional, and just works really well. It's become my go-to example when I want to show someone how technical docs can actually look good.

- **Why it's awesome**: Typography that doesn't hurt your eyes, navigation that makes sense, and they know how to use whitespace
- **What I learned**: Tech docs don't have to be boring—you can make them both useful and pretty
- **Design wins**: Minimalist vibes with smart color choices and spacing that just feels right
